## Benchmark Results (4,000 Generations)

**Performance Metrics:**
- **Agency (A):** 0.984 (Extremely High) - Agents solved nearly all standard tasks.
- **Complexity (C):** 0.940 (High) - Influenced by high success rates.
- **Diversity (D):** 0.142 (Low) - Indicates premature convergence; agents likely adopted a uniform strategy.

**Mathematical Output:**
- **Total Conjectures:** 75,615
- **Proven Theorems:** 561 (0.74% Proof Rate)
- **Sample Theorem:** `(4 + 2) = (2 + 4)`
- **Observation:** The generated theorems are trivial tautologies. The system currently lacks the capacity for deep novelty or finding non-obvious mathematical relationships.

## Recommendations for State-of-the-Art (SOTA) Advancement

To advance the Open-Ended Evolution Agency Simulator to a state-of-the-art level in mathematical discovery, we propose the following architectural upgrades:

### 1. Neuro-Symbolic Evolution (Hybrid Architecture)
**Current Issue:** Agents primarily use fixed numeric weights or simple ASTs with limited mutation operators.
**Recommendation:** Implement a true Neuro-Symbolic architecture.
- **Symbolic:** Use Genetic Programming (GP) or Tree-Structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) for manipulating mathematical expressions (ASTs).
- **Nueral:** Use small, specialized neural networks (or GNNs) to guide the search for proofs and to evaluate the "interestingness" of a conjecture.
- **Benefit:** Allows for learning structural patterns in mathematics rather than just parameter tuning.

### 2. Integration of Formal Verification Tools (Lean/Coq)
**Current Issue:** "Proof" is currently approximated by random sampling (checking if LHS == RHS for random inputs). This is not rigorous and cannot verify abstract properties.
**Recommendation:** Integrate a connection to a formal proof assistant like **Lean 4** or **Coq**.
- **Action:** Agents generate conjectures in a formal syntax.
- **Verification:** An external service attempts to find a proof strategy or allows the agent to output a sequence of tactics.
- **Benefit:** Guarantees correctness and allows the system to contribute to formal mathematics libraries.

### 3. Open-Ended Adversarial Curriculum (PAIRED)
**Current Issue:** Tasks are generated by a static generator, leading to the observed 99% success rate and lack of diversity.
**Recommendation:** Implement an algorithm similar to **PAIRED (Protagonist Antagonist Induced Regret Environment Design)**.
- **Mechanism:** Evolve a population of "Teacher" agents whose goal is to create math problems that are *too hard* for the current population but *solvable* by an "Expert" agent.
- **Benefit:** Automatically ensures the curriculum complexity scales with the agents' ability, preventing saturation (Agency ~1.0) and driving continuous open-ended learning.

### 4. Large Language Model (LLM) Mutation Operators
**Current Issue:** Random mutations often break the validity of mathematical expressions or result in nonsense.
**Recommendation:** Use a frozen LLM (e.g., Gemini Flash/Pro) as a mutation operator.
- **Action:** Prompt the LLM with the current best conjecture and ask for a "more general" or "variant" form.
- **Benefit:** LLMs have encoded priors about mathematical structure, making mutations significantly more likely to be valid and interesting (Quality-Diversity search).

### 5. Intrinsic Motivation for Novelty
**Current Issue:** Diversity ended up very low (0.14).
**Recommendation:** Replace simple fitness based on "solved count" with **Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC)**.
- **Action:** Reward agents not just for solving problems, but for finding *unique* solution paths or generating conjectures that are semantically different from the population archive.
