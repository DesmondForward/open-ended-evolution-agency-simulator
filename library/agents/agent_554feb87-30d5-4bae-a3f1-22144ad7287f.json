  "description": "Agent 554feb87-30d5-4bae-a3f1-22144ad7287f emerged by tightly coupling agency to both complexity and environmental pressure: strong A–U coupling (k_AU=0.99) let it reliably convert even mild difficulty (U=0.10) into goal-directed behavior, while balanced A–C and C–D couplings (k_AC=0.5, k_CD=0.5) kept structure and variety aligned rather than competing. Its lineage shows repeated instability when diversity-to-difficulty pathways were perturbed (k_DU, k_D_decay updates often preceded agency drops), followed by recovery when complexity and agency decay were tuned down (k_C_decay, k_A_decay adjustments), culminating in a high-agency, high-complexity, high-diversity equilibrium at emergence (A=0.994, C=0.986, D=0.979).",
