Its emergence was shaped by repeated micro-adjustments to regulation parameters—especially k_C_decay and k_U—that alternately destabilized and restored performance, until the final configuration preserved high diversity (0.961) and near-threshold complexity (0.902) without triggering any constraint violations.",
