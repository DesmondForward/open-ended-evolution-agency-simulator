  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by tightly balancing slow agency loss (k_A_decay=0.0008) with strong difficulty-coupled drive (k_AU=0.99) in a low-difficulty niche (U=0.10), letting it accumulate agency despite repeated destabilizations. Its emergence was shaped by selective tuning of diversity dynamics—after multiple k_D_decay shocks that alternately suppressed and restored agency, the later boost in k_D_growth (0.5) helped preserve high Diversity (0.970) and Complexity (0.923) long enough for agency to stabilize at A≈1.00.",
