  "description": "Agent 1293cec2-dca0-4c4e-8a3b-e03ec2d3a647 emerged by tightly coupling agency to environmental difficulty (k_AU=0.995) while keeping its internal state from eroding (very low k_A_decay=0.0008) under a low-difficulty regime (U=0.10). Its path shows sensitivity to structural turnover: repeated tuning of complexity decay (k_C_decay) produced the main rises/falls in agency, and it stabilized only after balancing diversity dynamics (low k_D_decay=0.001, k_D_growth=0.5) and removing difficulty-driven diversity perturbation (k_DU=0), allowing high Complexity (0.932) and near-max Diversity (0.989) to support sustained Agency (0.993).",
