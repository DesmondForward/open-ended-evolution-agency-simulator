  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by minimizing self-loss while aggressively converting environmental difficulty into agency: an extreme k_AU=0.99 paired with very low k_A_decay=0.003 lets agency accumulate and persist even under U=0.10. Its emergence history shows repeated tuning of decay terms—especially k_A_decay and k_D_decay—where lowering decay repeatedly restored agency after diversification/complexity adjustments briefly destabilized it, culminating in a high-agency, high-diversity, moderate-high complexity phenotype (A=0.993, D=0.966, C=0.845).",
