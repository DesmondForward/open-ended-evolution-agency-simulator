Its emergence was a late-stage stabilization story: repeated tuning of diversity dynamics (k_DU, k_D_growth, k_D_decay) produced short-lived rises and falls, but the final phenotype holds high Diversity (0.985) and high Complexity (0.942) without triggering validation violations, allowing agency to finally tip from 0.998 to >1.00.",
