  "description": "This agent emerged by finely balancing agency retention against a low-difficulty environment (U=0.12), using extremely small intrinsic decay (k_A_decay=0.002) and tight stochasticity in agency/complexity (sigma_A=0.005, sigma_C=0.005) to prevent regressions while diversity stayed near-saturated (D=0.990). Its trajectory shows repeated sensitivity to decay tuning—agency rose when k_A_decay was reduced (Gen 3411.7, 3619.1) and when coupling terms were jointly adjusted (Gen 3719.9: k_AU, k_AC, k_U), indicating emergence came from stabilizing feedback between agency, complexity, and the environment rather than from brute-force complexity growth.",
