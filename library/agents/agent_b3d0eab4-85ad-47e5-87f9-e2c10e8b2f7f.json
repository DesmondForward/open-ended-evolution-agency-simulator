Its emergence was catalyzed by a sequence where tuning cross-couplings (k_CD=0.5, k_AC=0.49) and reducing complexity decay (k_C_decay=0.1) produced a sustained agency lift, even after a difficulty uptick (U raised to 0.11) temporarily knocked agency down—followed by recovery when k_U and k_A_decay were rebalanced.",
