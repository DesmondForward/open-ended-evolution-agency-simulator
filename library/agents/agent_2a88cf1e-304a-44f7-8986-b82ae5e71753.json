  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by finely balancing Complexity→Diversity coupling (k_CD=0.48) with a near-matched Agency↔Complexity feedback (k_AC=0.49), letting it convert structural gains into agency without over-amplifying volatility. Its emergence was shaped by repeated tuning of decay terms: reductions and rebalancing in k_D_decay and k_C_decay produced stepwise agency recoveries, while a very small difficulty-coupling (k_DU=0.0015) and moderate k_U=0.38 helped it remain resilient even after the late environmental shift to U=0.11 that briefly suppressed agency.",
