  "description": "This agent emerged as a tightly-regulated controller that converts environmental pressure into action (k_AU=1) while damping volatility via short memory (tau=5) and very low agency noise (sigma_A=0.005). Its lineage shows repeated sensitivity to diversity decay tuning (multiple k_D_decay changes often dropped Agency), but the decisive rise came when coupling terms and environment handling were rebalanced together (Gen 3719: k_A_decay, k_AU, k_AC, k_U → Agency rose), allowing it to recover even after the imposed difficulty shift to U=0.10 briefly suppressed performance.",
