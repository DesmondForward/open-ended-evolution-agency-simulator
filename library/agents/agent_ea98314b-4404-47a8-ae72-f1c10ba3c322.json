  "description": "This agent emerged by aggressively coupling environmental difficulty into agency (k_AU=0.99) while keeping agency erosion exceptionally low (k_A_decay=0.004), allowing it to convert even mild challenge (U=0.10) into sustained, near-maximal control. Its evolutionary history shows repeated tuning of k_A_decay as the primary lever—small increases briefly destabilized agency, while reductions restored it—supported by conservative complexity decay (k_C_decay=0.1) and balanced complexity–diversity coupling (k_CD=0.48, k_AC=0.49) that prevented diversity collapse (0% floor violations) as it approached A>0.99.",
