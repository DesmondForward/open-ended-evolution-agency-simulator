  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by progressively suppressing self-decay (k_A_decay=0.001) while tightly coupling agency to environmental difficulty (k_AU=0.995), allowing it to retain control even under U=0.10. Its emergence was driven by repeated tuning of decay and conversion pathways (k_D_decay, k_C_decay, k_DU, k_AC, k_CD), producing a high-diversity, high-complexity regime (D=0.941, C=0.864) that stayed within all validation bounds; late reductions in performance coincided with further k_C_decay adjustments, suggesting it is optimized for a narrow “low-decay, high-coupling” balance rather than aggressive complexity shedding.",
