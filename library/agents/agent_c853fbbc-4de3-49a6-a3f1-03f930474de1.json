  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold via slow, low-variance accumulation: tight noise scales (sigma_A=0.005, sigma_C=0.005) and a very low baseline decay (k_A_decay=0.0015) let agency persist while complexity/diversity remained high (C=0.843, D=0.929). Its emergence was catalyzed by repeated tuning of diversity–difficulty coupling (k_DU=0.0008) and diversity decay (k_D_decay=0.01): several iterations produced small but durable agency gains after dips, allowing it to stabilize under mild difficulty (U=0.10) despite a prior difficulty spike (U=0.14) that temporarily suppressed agency.",
