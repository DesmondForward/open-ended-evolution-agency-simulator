  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by minimizing agency loss while keeping complexity and diversity high (A=0.993, C=0.834, D=0.961) in a relatively gentle environment (U=0.08). Its lineage shows repeated sensitivity to difficulty and decay tuning: agency dropped sharply when U was raised (to 0.14) and during multi-parameter perturbations, but it recovered when k_A_decay and k_C_decay were adjusted downward and when k_DU was carefully moderated—consistent with a phenotype that preserves agency through low decay and strong A–U coupling (k_AU=0.99) rather than brute-forcing through high difficulty.",
