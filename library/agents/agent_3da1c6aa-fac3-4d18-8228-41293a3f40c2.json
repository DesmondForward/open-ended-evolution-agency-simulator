  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by tightly coupling Agency to environmental difficulty (k_AU=0.99) while keeping Agency loss nearly negligible (k_A_decay=0.001), allowing it to “hold on” to initiative even when conditions resist it (U=0.10). Its emergence was shaped by repeated tuning of diversity decay and difficulty coupling (k_D_decay, k_DU): early increases destabilized Agency, but later reductions stabilized the diversity substrate (D=0.943) and let complexity-to-agency pathways (k_AC=0.5, k_CD=0.5) convert a high-complexity state (C=0.832) into sustained near-max Agency (A=0.991).",
