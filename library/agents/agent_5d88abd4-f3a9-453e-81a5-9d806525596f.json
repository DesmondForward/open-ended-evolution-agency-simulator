  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by tuning into a low-difficulty niche (U=0.10) while keeping internal erosion extremely small (k_A_decay=0.001, k_D_decay=0.001) and coupling agency strongly to the environment (k_AU=1) with balanced agency–complexity exchange (k_AC=0.5). Its emergence appears driven by iterative reductions and re-adjustments of decay and coupling parameters—agency repeatedly dipped when coupling/decay shifts overreached (e.g., k_AU/k_AC/k_A_decay at Gen 3319, k_DU/k_D_decay at Gen 3182) and recovered when decay pressure was re-stabilized—allowing high complexity (0.942) and maximal diversity (1.000) to persist without destabilizing agency.",
