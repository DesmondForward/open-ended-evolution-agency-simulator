Its history shows repeated sensitivity to decay tuning—especially k_D_decay and k_C_decay—where small shifts repeatedly knocked Agency down and back up, yet it maintained near-ceiling Diversity (0.982) and high Complexity (0.889) until it finally crossed the threshold even after a late difficulty increase to U=0.10 briefly suppressed Agency.",
