  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by tightly coupling agency to complexity (k_AC=0.5) while keeping both volatility (sigma_A=0.005, sigma_C=0.005) and long-term erosion low (k_A_decay=0.0005, k_C_decay=0.01). Its lineage shows repeated agency collapses whenever decay terms or diversity dynamics were perturbed, but a key rebound occurred when diversity-to-difficulty leakage was tuned (k_DU adjusted; k_DU=0.0005), effectively insulating diversity from the low-difficulty environment (U=0.10) and letting agency consolidate rather than dissipate.",
