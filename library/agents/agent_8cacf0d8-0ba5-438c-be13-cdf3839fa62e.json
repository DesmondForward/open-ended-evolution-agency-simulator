  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by repeatedly tuning its internal decay channels rather than relying on environmental coupling: multiple reductions/adjustments to complexity decay (k_C_decay) produced consistent agency gains, while late-stage tweaks to agency decay (k_A_decay) often destabilized it and caused dips. In a low-difficulty habitat (U=0.10) with no direct diversity-from-environment boost (k_DU=0), it maintained very high diversity (0.993) and near-max complexity (0.910), effectively “skating” agency upward by balancing C↔D coupling (k_CD=0.5) and keeping A-loss minimal (k_A_decay=0.0005) until it finally surpassed the prior best (A≈1.000).",
