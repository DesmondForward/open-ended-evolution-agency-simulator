  "description": "This agent emerged by tuning its “leak rates” (k_A_decay, k_C_decay, k_D_decay) into a narrow stability corridor, repeatedly finding that reduced decay reliably lifted Agency while overly aggressive tweaks caused collapses. With very high coupling from difficulty into agency (k_AU=0.99) but operating in a low-difficulty niche (U=0.10), it converts even mild environmental pressure into decisive action, maintaining strong Diversity (0.944) and solid Complexity (0.830) without triggering validation violations.",
