  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by repeatedly tuning its internal “coherence economy”: small reductions and re-balancing in complexity decay (k_C_decay) and diversity decay (k_D_decay) produced consistent agency rebounds, while several increases in agency decay (k_A_decay) caused temporary collapses. In a low-difficulty environment (U=0.10), it stabilized high diversity (0.990) and strong complexity (0.829) with very low stochasticity in agency/complexity (sigma_A=sigma_C=0.005), allowing incremental parameter improvements to compound into A=0.984 despite late-stage multi-parameter perturbations that briefly knocked it down.",
