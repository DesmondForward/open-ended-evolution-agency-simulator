  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by repeatedly fine-tuning its loss terms—especially k_A_decay and k_D_decay—so Agency could accumulate instead of bleeding off, with most parameter updates producing net gains across the run. It emerged in a relatively gentle environment (U=0.10) by maintaining high Diversity (0.954) and solid Complexity (0.833), using strong A–U coupling (k_AU=0.99) and moderate C–D coupling (k_CD=0.48) to convert environmental signal into action while keeping decay low enough to avoid instability.",
