Its lineage shows repeated instability when diversity–difficulty coupling and diversity decay were perturbed (k_DU, k_D_decay updates repeatedly drove Agency down), but a mid-run rebalancing of environmental weighting and complexity decay (k_U, k_C_decay) produced the decisive recovery that allowed near-unity Agency to finally tip over 1.00.",
