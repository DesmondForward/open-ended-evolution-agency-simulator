  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by tuning its internal decay dynamics rather than chasing raw complexity: repeated micro-adjustments to k_D_decay and k_A_decay (with tau=5 smoothing) gradually stabilized agency gains after several destabilizing parameter shifts. In a low-difficulty niche (U=0.10) with k_DU=0, it didn’t need diversity-to-environment coupling; instead, it maintained high diversity (0.975) and moderate complexity (0.842) while using strong A↔C coupling (k_AC=0.5) and A→U sensitivity (k_AU=1) to convert stable internal structure into just-enough agency without triggering validation violations.",
