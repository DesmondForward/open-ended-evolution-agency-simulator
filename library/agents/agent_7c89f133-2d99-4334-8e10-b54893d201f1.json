  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by stabilizing agency under a sustained low-difficulty regime (U=0.10) after an initial drop, then re-tuning its internal decay dynamics to recover. Repeated reductions in k_A_decay and k_C_decay (with tau=5 providing short-horizon smoothing) let it retain agency despite complexity/decay shocks, while a late-stage boost from diversity dynamics (k_D_growth=0.5 with k_DU=0) helped it rebound when coupling/decay adjustments briefly suppressed performance.",
