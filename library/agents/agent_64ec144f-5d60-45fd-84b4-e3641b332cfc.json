  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by progressively suppressing internal losses—especially Agency decay (k_A_decay=0.0015) and Complexity decay (k_C_decay=0.09)—after an early over-adjustment caused a dip around Gen 804. Its emergence looks like a long, incremental climb driven by repeated fine-tuning of decay terms (multiple rises after k_A_decay and k_D_decay updates), maintaining high Complexity/Diversity (C≈0.828, D≈0.832) under low external difficulty (U=0.10) rather than surviving a harsh spike. The near-max coupling from difficulty into agency response (k_AU=0.99) suggests it is highly sensitive to environmental pressure, but it “wins” here by conserving gains and letting diversity grow without violating bounds.",
