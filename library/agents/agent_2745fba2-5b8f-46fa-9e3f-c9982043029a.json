  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by operating in a low-difficulty niche (U=0.10) where its near-maximal difficulty-to-agency coupling (k_AU=0.99) could steadily convert environmental signal into coherent action without destabilizing. After the Gen 50 parameter update increased decay pressure (k_A_decay and k_D_decay), it avoided collapse by keeping agency decay extremely low (k_A_decay=0.002) and maintaining tight noise control (sigma_A=0.005, sigma_C=0.005), allowing complexity to build (C=0.829) while preserving maximal diversity (D=1.000).",
