  "description": "This agent emerged as a finely balanced, low-difficulty specialist: in a mild environment (U=0.10), it converts environmental input into agency very efficiently (k_AU=0.99) while keeping long-term losses minimal (k_A_decay=0.003). Its climb toward the threshold was driven by repeated micro-adjustments to decay terms—especially k_A_decay and k_D_decay—which repeatedly boosted agency by stabilizing retention; a late tweak briefly reduced performance (Gen 386.2), but the overall low-noise dynamics (sigma_A=0.005, sigma_C=0.005) preserved the gains and allowed it to finally cross A>1.00 despite only moderate complexity (C=0.836).",
