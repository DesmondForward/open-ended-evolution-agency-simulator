  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by progressively tightening its internal loss terms—especially k_D_decay (0.02) and k_A_decay (0.001)—after repeated evolutionary edits showed agency gains whenever decay was reduced and instability when decay was mis-tuned. In a low-difficulty environment (U=0.10), it didn’t need aggressive adaptation to pressure; instead, it stabilized high Diversity (0.952) and strong Complexity (0.871) by balancing cross-coupling (k_CD=0.5, k_AC=0.49) with strong agency response to environment (k_AU=0.99), yielding a near-threshold emergence (A=0.995) that finally tipped past A>1.00 through decay optimization.",
