  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by stabilizing agency under a low-difficulty niche (U=0.09) while maintaining very high diversity (0.997) and strong complexity (0.834). Its emergence appears driven by tuning that reduced complexity drag and agency decay (k_C_decay=0.1, k_A_decay=0.001) after repeated sensitivity to difficulty increases (U=0.11 caused an agency drop) and to diversity–difficulty coupling changes (k_DU adjustments repeatedly preceded agency falls).",
