  "description": "This agent emerged in a low-difficulty niche (U=0.10) by tightly coupling complexity and diversity into agency (k_AC=0.49, k_CD=0.46) while keeping stochastic drift minimal (sigma_A=0.005, sigma_C=0.005). Its lineage shows repeated sensitivity to agency decay—multiple k_A_decay increases caused drops—followed by recovery when decay pressures were rebalanced (k_C_decay and k_D_decay adjustments), culminating in a stable, high-agency attractor (A=0.994) without any validation violations.",
