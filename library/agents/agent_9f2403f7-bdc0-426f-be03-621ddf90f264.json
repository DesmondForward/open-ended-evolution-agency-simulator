In a low-difficulty environment (U=0.10) with strong Agency-from-uncertainty coupling (k_AU=1) and moderate complexity/diversity coupling (k_AC=0.5, k_CD=0.5), it emerged by minimizing internal leakage rather than by exploiting a difficulty spike—maintaining high Diversity (0.984) while keeping Complexity steady (0.840).",
