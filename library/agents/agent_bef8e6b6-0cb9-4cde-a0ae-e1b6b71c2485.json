  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by finely balancing self-decay and coupling: low k_A_decay (0.0005) preserved agency gains while moderate k_CD/k_AC (0.5/0.5) kept complexity and agency mutually reinforcing. Its emergence trajectory shows repeated sensitivity to decay tuning—agency rose after reductions/retuning of k_C_decay and k_A_decay (gens 4104, 4139, 4178, 4250) and fell when those same decay knobs were pushed the wrong way (gens 3977, 4028, 4213, 4281), indicating a narrow but exploitable stability corridor under low environmental difficulty (U=0.10) rather than a difficulty-spike survival strategy.",
