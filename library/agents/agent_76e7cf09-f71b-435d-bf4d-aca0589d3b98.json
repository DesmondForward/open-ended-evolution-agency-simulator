  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by tightly coupling Agency to both Complexity and environmental difficulty (k_AC=0.5, k_AU=1) while keeping Agency erosion extremely low (k_A_decay=0.005), allowing small gains to accumulate at U=0.10. Its emergence appears to be a stabilizer’s victory: repeated tuning of complexity decay (k_C_decay) and diversity decay (k_D_decay) caused oscillations—several drops followed by recoveries—until a low-decay, low-noise regime (sigma_A=0.005, sigma_C=0.005) let Agency settle above 0.99 despite prior parameter shocks.",
