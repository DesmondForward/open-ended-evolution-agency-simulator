  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by repeatedly rebalancing its loss terms: most emergence gains followed coordinated reductions in k_A_decay and k_D_decay, preserving agency while keeping diversity from collapsing. In a low-difficulty niche (U=0.10), its near-max coupling k_AU=0.99 and moderate k_AC=0.49 let small, stable adjustments compound over long horizons (tau=5), yielding a controlled climb to A>1 without triggering any bounds or diversity-floor violations.",
