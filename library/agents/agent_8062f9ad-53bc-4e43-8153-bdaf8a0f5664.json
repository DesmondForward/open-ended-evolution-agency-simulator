  "description": "This agent emerged by tightly coupling Agency to both Complexity and Diversity (k_AC=0.5, k_CD=0.5) while keeping Agency decay extremely low (k_A_decay=0.001), allowing gains to accumulate and persist across generations. Its rise tracks repeated tuning of the Agency–environment pathway (k_AU=0.995) and careful damping of Diversity loss (k_D_decay=0.012), yielding high Diversity (0.964) and strong Complexity (0.879) at the moment it crossed A>0.99. It showed mild fragility to the late difficulty shift (U set to 0.10 caused a dip), but the overall parameter set remained resilient enough to sustain near-maximal agency under low-to-moderate challenge.",
