  "description": "This agent emerged by progressively suppressing self-erosion: repeated reductions in k_A_decay and k_D_decay (with a later assist from k_C_decay) repeatedly lifted Agency toward the threshold, effectively conserving intent under low environmental difficulty (U=0.10). Its near-threshold state (A=0.996) with high Diversity (0.950) and strong A–U coupling (k_AU=0.99) suggests it stabilized agency by minimizing decay rather than by chasing higher Complexity, surviving several late destabilizing tweaks (notably to k_D_decay and k_CD) without violating bounds or diversity floors.",
