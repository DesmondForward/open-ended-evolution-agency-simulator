  "description": "This agent emerged by repeatedly tuning down decay pathways—especially k_A_decay and k_D_decay—creating a ratcheting effect where agency could accumulate and persist rather than bleed off between steps. In a low-difficulty environment (U=0.10), its very strong agency–uncertainty coupling (k_AU=0.99) and moderate A–C/D couplings (k_AC=0.49, k_CD=0.48), paired with low noise in A and C (sigma_A=0.005, sigma_C=0.005), let it convert mild environmental signal into stable, above-threshold agency without needing extreme complexity shocks.",
