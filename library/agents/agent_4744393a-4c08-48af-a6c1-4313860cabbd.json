  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by tightly coupling agency to environmental difficulty (k_AU=0.99) while keeping agency decay extremely low (k_A_decay=0.0005), allowing it to retain gains even after multiple destabilizing parameter edits. It initially stumbled when U was set to 0.10 and when diversity/complexity decay terms were perturbed, but a later rebound came from rebalancing diversity dynamics (k_D_growth=0.5 with k_D_decay=0.003) and tuning environmental responsiveness (k_U=0.38), yielding a high-agency, high-complexity, high-diversity phenotype (A=0.992, C=0.952, D=0.991) that is resilient under mild difficulty.",
