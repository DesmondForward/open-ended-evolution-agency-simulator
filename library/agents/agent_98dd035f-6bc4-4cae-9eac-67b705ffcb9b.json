  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by tightly coupling agency to both complexity and environmental difficulty (k_AC=0.5, k_AU=1, k_U=0.35) while keeping its internal state exceptionally low-noise (sigma_A=0.005, sigma_C=0.005), allowing small parameter gains to compound into reliable control. Its lineage shows agency sensitivity to tuning: early boosts came from strengthening the agency pathways (k_AU/k_AC/k_U) and later recovery required careful reduction of agency decay (k_A_decay=0.001) after a difficulty shift to U=0.10 temporarily knocked performance down; it ultimately stabilized by maintaining maximal diversity (D=1.0) with slow diversity loss (k_D_decay=0.001) despite several destabilizing decay/growth adjustments.",
