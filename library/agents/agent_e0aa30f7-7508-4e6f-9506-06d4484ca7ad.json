  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by running a low-friction control loop: extremely strong difficulty-to-agency coupling (k_AU=0.99) under a mild environment (U=0.10), while keeping agency noise and decay low (sigma_A=0.005, k_A_decay=0.02). Its lineage shows repeated tuning of k_A_decay and k_D_decay—early reductions boosted agency (Gen ~50), but later adjustments briefly destabilized it (Gen ~120 and ~179) before it re-stabilized, suggesting emergence came from finding a narrow balance where diversity stays high (0.980) without eroding agency.",
