  "description": "This agent crossed the Agency Threshold by progressively suppressing self-erosion (very low k_A_decay=0.001) while keeping agency tightly regulated (sigma_A=0.005, tau=5), allowing gains to accumulate instead of bleeding off between steps. Its emergence was reinforced by repeated co-tuning of diversity turnover (k_D_growth=0.5 with low k_D_decay=0.02) and weak difficulty-coupling (k_DU=0.0005, U=0.14), making it resilient to environmental drag; the late dip when k_C_decay and k_U shifted suggests it is sensitive to complexity attrition and direct difficulty pressure rather than diversity dynamics.",
