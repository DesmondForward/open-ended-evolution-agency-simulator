  "description": "This agent crossed the threshold by tightly coupling agency to environmental difficulty (k_AU=0.99) while keeping internal state noise low (sigma_A=0.005, sigma_C=0.005), allowing it to hold near-max agency even under U=0.10. Its emergence was not a smooth climb: repeated tuning of diversity decay (k_D_decay) produced oscillations in agency until the late-stage adjustment pairing higher diversity growth with controlled decay (Gen 1635.4) restored resilience after the difficulty increase (Gen 1597.8), enabling a stable, high-complexity/high-diversity operating point (C=0.916, D=0.991) at A=0.994.",
